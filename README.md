## Q1- Why Do We Need @Bean When @Component Also Creates Beans? 🤔
Both `@Bean` and `@Component` create Spring-managed beans, but they are used in different scenarios.

| Feature           | @Bean                                                               | @Component                                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Usage             | Used inside `@Configuration` classes to manually create beans.      | Used to mark a class for automatic detection.                 |
| Control           | Full control over object creation and configuration.                | Spring creates the bean automatically.                        |
| External Classes? | Can be used for third-party classes (like REST clients, database connections). | Only works on classes you own and annotate.                   |
| Customization     | Allows modifying how the bean is created (e.g., constructor args, method calls). | Limited customization.                                        |
